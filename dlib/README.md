# dlib - Deep Learning utiltity library

This is collection of tools I have found useful for Deep Learning research. It is opinionated towards PyTorch Lightning + Weights & Biases.

# Installation
The easiest way to use `dlib` is to run in your existing repository. This will clone all files inside a root-level `dlib` folder.
```bash
git subtree --prefix ./dlib/  add https://github.com/konstantinjdobler/dlib.git main --squash
```

Alternatively, just copy all files manually.
